# Windows Setup Guide

Since you're having issues with npm, here are several ways to get the extension working:

## Option 1: Use the Pre-compiled Version (Immediate)

✅ **Already Done!** I've created a pre-compiled JavaScript version in the `out/` folder, so you can test the extension right away:

1. **Open VS Code** in this folder
2. **Press F5** to launch Extension Development Host
3. **Open Chat** (`Ctrl+Alt+I`)
4. **Type** `@progress` to start using the extension

## Option 2: Install Node.js Manually

### Method A: Download from Website
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the "LTS" version for Windows
3. Run the installer as Administrator
4. Restart your terminal/VS Code
5. Run: `npm install`

### Method B: Use Chocolatey (if you have it)
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
choco install nodejs
```

### Method C: Complete the winget installation
The winget installation may have started but needs a restart:
1. **Restart your computer**
2. **Open a new PowerShell terminal**
3. **Test with:** `node --version`
4. **If working, run:** `npm install`

## Option 3: Use VS Code's Built-in Terminal

Sometimes VS Code's integrated terminal has different PATH settings:
1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Open Terminal** (`Ctrl+` `)
3. **Try:** `node --version`
4. **If working:** `npm install`

## Troubleshooting npm install

If you get Node.js working but npm install fails:

### Permission Issues:
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator, then:
npm install
```

### Network/Proxy Issues:
```powershell
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Try with different registry
npm install --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

### Alternative Package Managers:
```powershell
# Try with yarn (if available)
yarn install

# Or with pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Testing Without npm

The extension is ready to test immediately with the pre-compiled version:

1. **Current Status**: ✅ Extension code ready
2. **To Test**: Press `F5` in VS Code
3. **Chat Commands Available**:
   - `@progress /simple` - Basic progress demo
   - `@progress /steps` - Multi-step progress
   - `@progress /file` - File processing demo  
   - `@progress /long` - Complex operation demo

## Development Workflow

### Without TypeScript compilation:
- Edit `out/extension.js` directly
- Press `F5` to test changes
- Not ideal for development, but works for quick testing

### With proper setup:
- Edit `src/extension.ts` (TypeScript source)
- Run `npm run compile` or `npm run watch`
- Press `F5` to test compiled version

## Next Steps

1. **Test the extension now** using F5
2. **Fix Node.js installation** when convenient
3. **Switch to TypeScript development** after npm works

The extension demonstrates all the progress indicator patterns and is ready to use immediately!
